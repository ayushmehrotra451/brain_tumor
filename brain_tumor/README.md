# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates **brain tumor classification** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** built with TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on MRI scan images to detect whether a tumor is present.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The notebook covers:
- Importing and exploring MRI scan dataset
- Preprocessing and normalizing image data
- Building a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Training the model and monitoring performance
- Evaluating with accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix
- Making predictions on test images

## ðŸ›  Requirements
Install the following dependencies before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python
```
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
